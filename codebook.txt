The dataset produced by run_analysis indicates average Samsung S sensor measures produced when a user is performing specified activities.  The dataset is a data table consisting of three columns:

- activity: one of {STANDING, SITTING, LAYING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS}
- measure: a mean or standard-deviation across a window of time during which the user is performing the activity.  Values of Measure are detailed below.
- averagevalue: the average (mean) value of the measure across all samples taken while any subject user is performing the activity.  This includes but training and test subjects.

Measure values specify a statistical estimate of readings from the Samsung S accelerometer or gyro sensor.  Measures taken in the time domain are prefixed by the letter "t"; measures in the frequency domain by the letter "f". The estimates of these measures present in this data set are either mean or standard deviation evaluated over a window of time around each time-series data point, with samples taken at  a rate of 50 Hz..  Some measures have separate components on the x, y and z directions. The following sensor measures are used in the result data: 

- tGravityAcc
- tBodyAccMag
- tGravityAccMag
- tBodyAccJerkMag
- tBodyGyroMag
- tBodyGyroJerkMag
- fBodyAccMag
- fBodyAccJerkMag
- fBodyGyroMag
- fBodyGyroJerkMag

- tBodyAccJerk (x,y,z)
- tBodyGyro (x,y,z)
- tBodyGyroJerk (x,y,z)
- fBodyAcc (x,y,z)
- fBodyAccJerk (x,y,z)
- fBodyGyro (x,y,z)

The label values in the measure column of the result specify: the estimate (mean or std), the measure, and where appropriate the component, in lowercase and separated by underscores.  Thus, to specify the mean of tBodyGyro measures in the y dirction would have the measure label, "mean_tbodygyro_y".
